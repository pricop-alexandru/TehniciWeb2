00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.376
Hey friends, welcome to Creative X.

00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:02.335
My name is Brad Hussey

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.294
and I've been designing

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.295
and building websites

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:05.672
since you were a baby,

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:06.965
unless you're older than me.

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.467
And in that case, remember MySpace

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:12.554
and dial up internet? That long.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.555
I'm going to give you 30

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:14.764
quick web design tips.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:15.890
Let's go

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.478
so if you're new to web

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:20.979
design,

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.856
just start learning by watching

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.315
tutorials and designing things.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:25.900
Even if your designs are not perfect

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.235
at first it's important

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.903
to start practicing.

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:30.113
You should have a plan before

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.322
you start working on a web

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.323
design project

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:34.242
usually means creating a site map

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:35.702
and a wireframe.

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.537
Knowing the basics of major web

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:39.873
design languages like HTML courses,

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.666
even JavaScript is empowering.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.126
Even if you never plan on

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:45.086
becoming a web developer,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.004
this knowledge can help

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.423
inform your design process.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.133
Also, you don't have to code

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.718
if you don't want to.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.261
You can use a modern website builder

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:53.928
that doesn't require

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:54.846
any coding at all.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.180
There are a lot

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.473
of really good options out there.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:58.099
My favorite is Editor X.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:59.100
You can build anything

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.351
you want in it.

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:01.519
Pick a style for your design

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.771
and stick to it.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:04.022
It can be minimalist,

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.982
brutalist, modern, playful,

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.109
or even anti design.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.527
Just be sure that you're consistent

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.904
with the style that you choose.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.072
If you want your typography

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:12.864
to look good,

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.407
there are some rules and standards

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.575
that you should follow.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.619
My favorite is the golden ratio.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.161
Choose a base

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.413
font size like 14 pixels,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.916
then multiply it by 1.618

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.418
to find the next font size up

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.631
so 14 multiplied by 1.618 is about

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.592
23 pixels and so on.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:33.426
This will help

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.302
you make your designs

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:35.345
more interesting

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.305
and a little bit more dramatic.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.139
Now, if Leonardo

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.849
da Vinci lived today,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.351
he would be a web designer

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.103
and he would use the golden ratio

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.646
for his font sizes.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.272
Paulo Da Vinci's lead

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.816
animations are fun

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:48.358
and they make

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.901
you look a little extra.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:50.735
They can also be used

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.487
to inform your user

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:53.905
what's happening on the website

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:54.864
or to give feedback

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:55.949
like a loading screen.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.741
You don't need to be

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:57.534
a motion designer

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.327
to add animations to your website.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.203
An editor

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:01.663
animating any element

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:03.081
takes just a few clicks

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.207
when designing your website.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.917
Decide on a primary action color

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:07.127
to create contrast

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.920
between different elements.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.921
This will help your visitors

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.464
know what's important

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.882
and maybe what's not as important.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:13.508
For example,

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.009
you can use a bright color

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.053
to draw attention to an order button.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.055
Images can slow down your website

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.890
and distract from your content,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.307
use them

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.268
sparingly to avoid overwhelming

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.519
your visitors

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.520
now I'm going to contradict

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.521
myself here,

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.898
but you can also use lots of images.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:30.817
The reality is

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:31.568
great designers

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.361
break rules all the time.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.154
If you choose to go

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.030
a little heavy on the images,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.531
at least

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.574
optimize them

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:38.950
to improve your load times.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.618
Find web design inspiration

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:41.911
from other websites.

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:42.871
Look at awards,

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.747
wsj.com site inspire

00:02:44.747 --> 00:02:46.708
Apple one page, love

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.877
even the editor blog for some ideas

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.628
for your own website designs.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.422
Now, when starting out in web design,

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.632
it's a good idea to use templates.

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.467
Templates help you create

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:57.677
professional looking websites

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:59.095
quickly and easily.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:02:59.804
Editor access

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:00.430
a lot of templates

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.889
that you can use

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.140
right out of the box.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.516
Make sure to use the correct

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.685
file formats for all of your images

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.145
and other assets.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:10.064
For example, images should be JPEGs

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.109
or pages, even gifs.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.445
Yes, I said gifs.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.988
There's not a word.

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.072
Logos

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.365
should be vector graphics,

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.909
which are SVG files.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.242
That way

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:22.577
you keep them nice and sharp

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.287
grids can be used for alignment

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.872
to create a well-organized

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.373
and balanced web design.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.416
They can also be used

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.335
to create unusual

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.337
and visually interesting structures

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.297
responsive grids are easy to set up

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:34.839
using editor

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.633
x simply out of container

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.051
choose make a grid

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.302
and then customize your settings

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.720
to match the design.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.306
Flexbox is amazing.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.474
It's used to create

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:45.934
websites and layouts

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:46.935
that look good on

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:47.810
any device,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.938
any size, any viewport or breakpoint.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.189
You can use it to align

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.358
elements create columns

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:54.525
and a lot more.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:56.361
Editor X uses Flexbox

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.446
with three different layout tools,

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.282
stacks, layers, and repeaters.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:02.575
These three tools

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:03.117
will help

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.702
you adjust your content across

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:05.912
all viewpoints

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:06.788
seamlessly

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:08.498
without you having to understand

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.041
how to code Flexbox,

00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:12.043
which can get a little hairy

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.211
let's talk whitespace.

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.504
If you don't have enough whitespace

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:15.129
on your website,

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.547
it can feel a little crowded

00:04:16.547 --> 00:04:17.715
and it's a sure sign

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:18.591
that you're a rookie.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.969
White space is that empty space

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.470
on a page

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.971
that helps

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.222
to separate elements,

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.265
improve readability,

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.225
and just give your website

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.268
some breathing room.

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.937
Everybody needs some space to breathe

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.523
whitespace to use a style guide,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:34.482
you can help

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:35.108
keep your fonts,

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.484
colors, and other design

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:37.860
elements consistent across

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.153
your entire website.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:40.238
It's especially helpful

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:41.531
if you're working with a team

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.074
to create a style guide an editor x.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.701
Just choose site styles.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.786
Set up your typography and colors,

00:04:47.203 --> 00:04:48.579
and whenever you design an element

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:49.205
that you will use

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:51.082
more than once on your website,

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.875
you can save it as a global asset.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:53.459
This way

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.669
it'll be easily accessible

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.671
across your entire site.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.047
Always look consistent,

00:04:58.047 --> 00:04:58.673
and that way

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:59.632
you make sure that your team

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.967
is using the same elements

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.011
when designing your website.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:03.553
Think about

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.430
who is going to be viewing

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.390
the website, the target audience.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.057
Remember that

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:09.183
they're going to be the ones

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.810
experiencing it and reading it.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.438
So make sure it's easy to understand

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:16.607
and navigate you simple fonts

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:17.066
and make sure

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:19.068
all the information is easy to find

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.571
when in doubt. Use one font.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:22.572
It's tempting

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:24.949
to want to express our creativity

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.075
and use all the fonts

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:26.951
that we think look

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.663
beautiful, appealing, cool, whatever

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.206
but your audience doesn't

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:34.417
care about your font preferences.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:34.834
Plus,

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:35.752
the more fonts you use

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.544
in your website,

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.755
the slower your website will load.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:39.339
And research

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.839
says you've

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.884
got about 50 milliseconds 55 zero

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:44.010
to create

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.928
a good first visual impression

00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:48.389
if your site takes 8 seconds to load

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.349
because of your seven

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.434
super cute fonts.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:52.268
Well,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:53.853
in the words of one of my favorite

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.146
nineties country songs

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:01.402
Helvetica is

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:02.737
a respectable sans serif font

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:03.237
and everybody

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:04.781
has it on their computer.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:05.823
So if you want to create

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.909
some visual interest and hierarchy,

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:08.743
you can play with font

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.161
weight, font size and color.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.037
To achieve that,

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.705
no need for a thousand fonts

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.874
unless you have a specific brand

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.542
with guidelines for using colors

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.336
or you're a professional designer,

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:19.462
it's probably best

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:20.713
that you stick to using

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.298
just a few colors.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.050
Color, science and color theory

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.802
can be difficult to understand.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:27.178
So when in doubt,

00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:28.679
just use black and white,

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:29.430
you can also use

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.098
a light shade

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.516
of black and a pale off

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.810
white for a more sophisticated look.

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:35.895
If you must add more color

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.021
to your website,

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.315
try to avoid primary colors

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:42.402
like red, green and blue.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:43.694
Instead, use different

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:44.695
shades, tints

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:46.989
and tones of those colors

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:47.865
to make your design

00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:48.825
look more appealing.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:50.076
Use a tool to help you

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.828
choose your colors for your website.

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:52.412
I recommend

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:53.496
using a website called

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.540
Coolhaus Stucco

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.125
Once you've established

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.334
your color palette,

00:06:58.334 --> 00:06:58.626
you can

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:00.670
then add those colors in Editor X

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.421
and then you're ready to

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.380
start building your site.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.840
There are three ways

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.342
to align the text on the web

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:09.303
left, center, and right.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.388
If you're not sure

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.556
which one to choose,

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.433
go with left alignment.

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.059
There's also justified alignment

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.686
but we're designing websites,

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.770
not newspapers.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.646
But Brad,

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:19.814
why don't we just center

00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:21.482
align everything?

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.733
People don't like reading

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:25.027
large chunks of centered text

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:27.405
even if they don't understand why.

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:29.866
So left align your text

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.576
unless you want to be considered

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.036
an anti designer, in which case

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.413
you should follow the next tip,

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.206
even if it's just to understand

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:38.040
it better.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.167
Like anti design.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.127
Take everything I've said so far

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:42.753
and do the literal opposite

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:51.762
make sure

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:53.347
your website looks good on

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.266
smart devices and fonts. Why?

00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.767
Because most people are addicted to

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.895
I mean, most people

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.480
for the most part,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.898
experience the internet

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:02.899
and your websites

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:04.108
on their smart device.

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.860
So it should probably look good on it

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.487
and it should load quickly.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:08.321
Have a nice layout

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:08.905
that's easy

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.615
to navigate on a mobile device.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.616
The call to action

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:12.700
should be easy to tap.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.077
You should use short paragraphs

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:16.037
now with Editor X,

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:17.330
you can easily modify

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.624
any element on your design

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:20.625
for each

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.626
and every breakpoint

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.960
without having to code

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.712
60 media queries.

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:25.254
Basically,

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:26.506
this means you have no excuse

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:28.466
for having an amazing website

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.343
on any device buttons

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.928
everybody likes a button,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:32.970
everybody likes clicking

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.222
them, tapping them, pressing

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:34.931
them, whatever

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.396
when using buttons on your website,

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:44.148
make sure they are consistent

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:45.066
and you have

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.817
a system for your buttons.

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:47.818
Now, what am I saying here?

00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:49.362
Think about it this way

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:50.655
you should choose a primary call

00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:51.697
to action style

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.324
and be consistent with it.

00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:54.617
If you have a secondary call

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.160
to action style for your buttons,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.912
make it different

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.497
by choosing a more muted color

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:00.623
or making it smaller,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.708
or simply just making it a link.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.626
If you're using Editor

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:05.419
X, you can keep these buttons

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.672
consistent across the entire website

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:09.799
by saving them as global assets.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.426
If your primary call to action

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:14.595
is hard to find or hidden from view,

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:16.722
you may be losing customers.

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.099
Make sure that your call to action

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.268
is always in view or just a short

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.519
scroll away.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.395
One way to get more people

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.479
to see your call to action

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.107
is by using a sticky bar

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:26.857
this is a bar

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:28.025
that will stay at the top

00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.277
or bottom of the screen.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:30.278
No matter where people

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.571
scroll on the page,

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:32.738
you can create a sticky bar

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.281
quite easily.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:33.906
An editor X

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:34.991
by clicking on the container.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.826
You want to be sticky,

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.994
choose settings

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.162
and set its position to sticky.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.080
When it comes to web

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.915
design, simplicity is often

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.917
the best way to go to many calls

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.002
to action on your page

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:47.086
can confuse and overwhelm

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:47.962
your visitors,

00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.797
leading to inaction

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.966
quite the opposite of call to action.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.135
Focus on one primary call to action

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:55.428
and make sure it's clear

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:56.721
and easy to find.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.473
Use, contrast size color position

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:00.850
to make it stand out.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.977
There's a saying that goes A rising

00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.354
tide lifts all boats

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:07.273
this is also true for web design.

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:09.025
If you want to improve your web

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.359
design skills,

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:10.818
join a web

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.612
design community and get involved.

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:13.571
There are many online

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:14.447
communities out there

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.240
that can help you learn about design

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.367
and improve your craft.

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:19.660
Most of these communities are happy

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.411
to help beginners

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:21.621
and experienced designers

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.247
learn and grow.

00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:24.790
Share your work, ask questions,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.459
give feedback, collaborate

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.169
and challenge one another to grow.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.253
It's one of the best ways

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:29.920
to get ahead

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.505
and not feel so isolated.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:32.048
In fact,

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.008
why not join the Creative X crew

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.259
it's our free community

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:36.427

00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:38.137

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:40.723

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:43.100
Just hit publish.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.852
It'll never be perfect,

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:47.021
so ship it and work on it live.

00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:48.939
You can get better at web design

00:10:48.939 --> 00:10:50.441
by practicing every day.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.276
The more you design and build stuff,

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:53.527
the better you'll get.

00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:55.571
Took me years to know how to do that.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.865
Even if you consider yourself

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:58.699
to be a pretty good web

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:01.035
designer, practice every day

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:01.869
and you'll become world

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:02.912
class at your craft

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:03.788
in fact, practice.

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:04.163
With me

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.956
by watching this series right here

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:07.375
where we build a creative agency

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.043
website in Editor X,

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.252
if you like these tips, let me know

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:10.961

00:11:10.961 --> 00:11:11.545
like button

00:11:11.545 --> 00:11:12.755
and subscribing to the channel
